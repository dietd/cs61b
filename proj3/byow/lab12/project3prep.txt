Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: the hexagon is the room and the tesselation is probably the hallway/putting the rooms together.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: Make room and make hallway methods

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: a hallway is a long stretch of walls and floor. rooms are different because they are enclosed spaces.

-----
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: My implementation differs from given one because I realized that you can't really make a add left add right neighbor thing. I have to think about abstractions carefully.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: Perhaps we can place a room then generate a random room with a hallway and try attaching it to the map.
